# QUARKUS-5866 - REST client support of TLS configuration updates

JIRA: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/QQE-674

Upstream issue: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/39677
Upstream PR: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/39762

Our customer reported that when a Uni operation fails (for instance, due to timeout in this case), the failured is cached.
This causes all subsequent calls with the same cache key to return the cached failure without calling the remote service again, until the cache is invalidated.
The fix ensures that when a Uni fails, the cache entry is invalidated and allows calls to retry the operation.

## Scope of the testing

Tests that failed Uni operations are not cached for all cache key generation strategies in Quarkus Cache.
We will simulate common failures scenarios that customers could face in production environments.
Tests will run in both JVM and native modes covering bare-metal and OpenShift deployments.

### Tests will cover these scenarios
   * Cache key generation strategies
     - No arguments method
     - Single argument method
     - Multiple arguments methos
     - Method with @CacheKey annotation

   * Simulated failure scenarios
     - Service unavailable (HTTP 503)
     - Timeout errors
     - Generic runtime exceptions
     
   * Other cases
     - Concurrent access during failures
     - Null values caching (should be cached)
     - Cache invalidation after failures
     - Cache key collisions


## Existing test coverage
Upstream test coverage includes a basic test in UniReturnTypeWithFailureTest that verifies failed Unis are not cached with a counter-mechanism.
Quarkus-qe/quarkus-test-suite has cache operations coverage in the cache modules.

### Impact on test suites and testing automation
Tests will be added to the cache/caffeine module:
- New test class: UniFailureCacheIT
- New resource class ReactiveFailureCacheResource

### Impact on resources
Test execution time will increase, I expect increase in the test execution time roughly in 2-4 minutes.

## Getting familiar with the feature
The following actions were taken to ensure familiarity:
- Analyzed the original issue https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/39677
- Review the fix implementation in PR https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/39762
- Take a look into cache key generation logic in a Quarkus guide https://quarkus.io/guides/cache
